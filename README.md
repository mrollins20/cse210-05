# CSE210-05: greed game

# TODO 
    -Fix issue with collision not working
    -(If time allows) Make some code to work around errors

## Overview: 
    Greed is a game where the player seeks to gather as many falling gems as possible. 
    The game continues until the player wishes to stop (or runs out of lives?).

## Running the Game:
To start the game, begin by running the "__main__.py" file. 

## Help/Information:
    There is a lot from this program that borrows similar elements already created for us in the rfk activity from the BYUI week07 activity, so to save time and help ensure quality, those essential components have been included.
